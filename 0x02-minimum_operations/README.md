# Minimum Operations - README

## Problem Description
The problem is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform a given number of 'H's into 'n' 'H's. The only available operations are "Copy All" and "Paste". Each operation can copy all the existing 'H's and paste them, thereby doubling the number of 'H's.

## Solution Approach
The provided code implements a recursive function `minOperations(n)` to solve the problem. Here's how the solution works:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, no operations are needed since there is already one 'H' present.
2. The code then proceeds to find the smallest prime factor of `n` by iterating from 2 to `n/2 + 1`.
3. If a prime factor `i` is found (i.e., `n` is divisible by `i`), the code recursively calls `minOperations(int(n/i))` to calculate the minimum number of operations required for `n/i` 'H's. The result of this recursive call is then added to `i`, which represents the number of operations needed to copy all 'H's and paste them.
4. The function returns the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` 'H's.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution depends on the prime factorization of `n`. In the worst case, where `n` is a prime number, the code will iterate from 2 to `n/2 + 1` to find the smallest prime factor. Therefore, the time complexity can be approximated as O(n/2) or simply O(n).

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the solution is O(1) since the code does not use any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

## Usage
To use this code, you can call the `minOperations(n)` function, where `n` is the desired number of 'H's. The function will return the minimum number of operations required.

Example usage:
```python
result = minOperations(6)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

In the above example, `minOperations(6)` calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform one 'H' into six 'H's, which is 5.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different inputs to test the solution.
